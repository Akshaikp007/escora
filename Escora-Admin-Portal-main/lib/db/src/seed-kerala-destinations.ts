Natural mineral springs near the beach are considered medicinally significant. Since the 1980s, Varkala has evolved into a bohemian-to-boutique destination with yoga retreats, Ayurvedic spas and clifftop dining, while retaining a quieter, more spiritual character than Kerala's other beach towns.",

The Nehru Trophy Snake Boat Race, held on Punnamada Lake every August, features chundan vallams over 100 feet long crewed by up to 100 rowers, while Alappuzha Beach and its 19th-century pier offer a quieter coastal counterpoint to the inland waterways.",

The Parassinikadavu Sri Muthappan Temple is unusual in staging Theyyam performances almost daily, not just seasonally. Muzhappilangad is India's only true drive-in beach, a 4-km stretch of firm sand where vehicles can be driven along the shore, and the wider district's plantation-covered hills and river estuaries — like Dharmadam Island — round out a coast that rewards travellers who go slow.",
